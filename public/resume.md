Projects & Software Development Experience

TrackMate (Capstone MERN) — Team Lead (2025)
• Led a team to build TrackMate, a MERN‑based asset‑tracking dashboard with role‑based views and audit trails.
• Designed API endpoints and React component architecture; built a local development environment using Docker Compose to run MongoDB, Node, and React containers.
• Developed seed scripts and JSON fixtures to simulate VPN‑gated data for offline development; managed .env configuration for dev vs production.
• Outcome: unblocked development without VPN and created a repeatable, self‑contained environment; emphasised that early architecture and tooling decisions pay dividends for teams.

VSM Tracker (Fleet Management MERN) — Full Stack (Personal Project) (2024)
• Replaced a cumbersome Smartsheet workflow with a full‑stack MERN application that tracks out‑of‑service vehicles for a nationwide fleet.
• Implemented a card‑based dashboard (Kanban) with visual status indicators, overdue badges, and quick‑action buttons to update unit statuses.
• Built a Node.js/Express API with MongoDB and JWT‑based authentication supporting admin and user roles; added routes for units, vendors, locations, notes, file uploads, and quick actions.
• Integrated email notifications for overdue units, estimate approvals, status changes and vendor communications using Gmail app passwords.
• Added file attachment capability, CSV/Excel import scripts to backfill data from Smartsheet exports and vendor management features.
• Deployed local and cloud environments using Docker Compose and wrote guides for network access, deployment, and Unraid MongoDB setup.

Hendershott Vendor Manager — Single‑Page Utility (2023)
• Created a lightweight HTML/JavaScript tool that generates pre‑filled mailto deep links and message templates for routine vendor emails.
• Reduced drafting time by ~50 % and improved accuracy and speed of repetitive communications across teams.
• Persisted user preferences via local storage and implemented a clean, responsive UI.

BoomPortal (Pi 5 + Sunshine/Moonlight) — Homelab Project (2023)
• Configured a Raspberry Pi 5 as a low‑latency game‑streaming server using Sunshine and Moonlight with controller mapping and Nginx Proxy Manager.
• Deployed services in Docker containers, set up reverse proxy with TLS certificates, and measured network performance (~12–18 ms wired latency, ~25–35 ms over Wi‑Fi 6).
• Documented configuration steps and automated updates for personal homelab operations.

Portfolio & Community Hub — Next.js + MDX (2023–Present)
• Developed a content‑driven portfolio and community hub using Next.js, MDX, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and App Router.
• Implemented case studies, blog posts, GitHub showcases, sitemap/robots, and basic analytics integration.
• Deployed via Netlify and Nginx with TLS; integrated with Contentlayer to source MDX files and automated deployments via GitHub Actions.

E‑Commerce Microservices (Java) — Personal Project (2023)
• Built a Spring Boot microservice to manage product inventory and order processing for a mock e‑commerce platform.
• Exposed REST APIs, integrated with a headless CMS and used MySQL for persistent storage.
• Configured NGINX as a reverse proxy and built a Jenkins pipeline to automate testing and deployment to Kubernetes; collaborated via GitLab.
