## Projects & Software Development Experience

### TrackMate (Capstone MERN) — Team Lead (2025)
- Led a team to build a MERN-based asset tracking dashboard with role-based views and audit trails.
- Designed API endpoints and React component architecture; built a Docker Compose environment (MongoDB, Node, React) for consistent local dev.
- Implemented seed scripts/JSON fixtures to simulate VPN-gated data; managed environment parity for dev vs prod.
- Outcome: Unblocked development without VPN and created a repeatable, self-contained environment; reinforced that early architecture/tooling decisions pay dividends.

### VSM Tracker (Fleet Management MERN) — Full Stack (2024)
- Replaced Smartsheet workflow with a full-stack app to track out-of-service units across a nationwide fleet.
- Built Node/Express API with MongoDB and JWT auth (admin/user roles); routes for units, vendors, locations, notes, file uploads.
- Added Kanban-style dashboard, overdue badges, quick actions, email notifications, and import scripts for CSV/Excel.
- Deployed via Docker Compose; documented Unraid MongoDB and deployment steps.

### Hendershott Vendor Manager — Single-Page Utility (2023)
- Lightweight HTML/JS tool to generate pre-filled mailto deep links and message templates for routine vendor emails.
- Results: ~50% faster drafting and fewer addressing mistakes; preferences stored in localStorage.

### BoomPortal (Pi 5 + Sunshine/Moonlight) — Homelab (2023)
- Configured Sunshine on Raspberry Pi 5, reverse-proxied via Nginx Proxy Manager, and tuned controller mappings.
- Observed ~12–18 ms wired latency and ~25–35 ms over Wi‑Fi 6; documented setup and maintenance.

### Digital Portfolio — Next.js + MDX (2023–Present)
- Built a content-driven portfolio using Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, and MDX.
- Features: MDX case studies, GitHub showcase, sitemap/robots, Netlify contact form, optional analytics; App Router and static generation.

### Retro Adventure Game — JavaScript (2025)
- Enhanced text adventure with modular architecture, improved parser, inventory and state systems; public GitHub repository.

### Where’s My App? — Utility (2025)
- Created a simple tracker to log app installations across devices (name, device, version, date, platform) for personal inventory.

### E-Commerce Microservices (Java) — Personal (2023)
- Spring Boot microservice for inventory and orders; REST APIs; MySQL; NGINX reverse proxy; Jenkins CI pipeline; GitLab collaboration.
