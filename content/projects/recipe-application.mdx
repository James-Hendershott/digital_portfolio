## Overview
Recipe Application was a semester-long team project for CS 3650, focused on building a full-featured recipe management system. The application allows users to store, search, organize, and share their favorite recipes in a centralized platform.

## Role & Stack
Team member working on [specific features - adjust based on your actual role] in collaboration with classmates. Built using modern web technologies with a focus on user experience and data management.

## Repository Note
This is a private repository as it was a collaborative academic project. Code access can be requested for review purposes.

## Problem
Home cooks and food enthusiasts often struggle with:
- Recipes scattered across multiple platforms (websites, books, notes)
- Difficulty searching their personal recipe collection
- No easy way to share recipes with friends and family
- Lack of organization by category, cuisine, or dietary restrictions

## Solution
Developed a web-based recipe management system with:
- User authentication and personal recipe collections
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Recipe categorization (cuisine type, meal type, dietary tags)
- Ingredient lists with shopping list integration
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Recipe sharing features

```javascript
// Example: Recipe data structure
const recipe = {
  title: "Recipe Name",
  author: "User ID",
  ingredients: [
    { name: "Flour", amount: "2 cups" },
    { name: "Sugar", amount: "1 cup" }
  ],
  instructions: ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
  tags: ["dessert", "vegetarian"],
  prepTime: 15,
  cookTime: 30,
  servings: 4
}
```

## Key Features
- **User Management**: Registration, login, and profile management
- **Recipe CRUD**: Create, read, update, and delete recipes
- **Search & Filter**: Find recipes by ingredients, tags, or keywords
- **Collections**: Organize recipes into custom collections
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Team Collaboration
Working on this project taught valuable lessons in:
- Version control with Git (branching, merging, pull requests)
- Code review processes
- Dividing work among team members
- Communication and coordination
- Integrating different components

## Results
- Functional recipe management system with complete CRUD operations
- Gained experience in team-based software development
- Learned to navigate merge conflicts and integration challenges
- Successfully delivered a working application on schedule

## What I Learned
- Collaborative development workflows
- Importance of clear communication in teams
- Database design for relational data (recipes, users, ingredients)
- Testing integration points between team members' code
- Time management and milestone planning
- Balancing individual contributions with team goals

## Technical Challenges
- Synchronizing database schema changes across the team
- Ensuring consistent code style and conventions
- Managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts
- Testing integration of independently developed features
