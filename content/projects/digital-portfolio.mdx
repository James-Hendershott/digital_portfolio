## Overview
This website serves as my living portfolio with case studies, a contact form, and a resume download.

## Highlights
- App Router (Next.js 16), React 19, TypeScript
- MDX content pipeline for project pages
- Private project access flow (request instead of public repo)
- Netlify-friendly contact form

## What I learned
- Ergonomic content loading with MDX
- Clean, accessible UI components with Tailwind v4
- Clear branching and PR workflow for small, focused changes
