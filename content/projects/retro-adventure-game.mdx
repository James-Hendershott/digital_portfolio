## Overview
Retro Adventure Game is the evolved version of my earlier text adventure project, rebuilt as a Python/Django app with persistent game state. It captures the nostalgia of classic text adventures while adding web interactivity and a retro CRT‑style theme.

## Role & Stack
Solo developer using Python, Django, and PostgreSQL.

## Background
This project originated from the 1980 Style Adventure Game (https://github.com/James-Hendershott/1980_Style_Adventure-Game.git) and represents a complete refactoring and expansion of the original concept.

## Problem
The original adventure game was a good start but needed:
- Better code organization for maintainability
- More sophisticated command parsing
- Expanded gameplay and story elements
- Improved state management
- Enhanced player feedback

## Solution
Rebuilt the game from the ground up with:
- Django project structure (apps, models, views) + PostgreSQL persistence
- Enhanced parser supporting more natural command patterns
- Expanded world with multiple locations and puzzles
- Session‑based progress tracking and save/load
- Retro CRT visual style (templates/static files)

```py
# Example: Django view handling a command (simplified)
def submit_command(request):
    cmd = request.POST.get("command", "").strip()
    game = get_game_for_session(request)
    result = game.process(cmd)  # updates state, returns messages
    return render(request, "game/play.html", {"game": game, "result": result})
```

## Gameplay Features
- Multiple interconnected locations to explore
- Inventory system for collecting and using items
- Puzzle-solving mechanics
- Save/load game state
- Contextual hints and help system

## Results
- More engaging player experience
- Cleaner, maintainable codebase
- Active development with regular improvements
- Foundation for future adventure game projects

## What I Learned
- Moving from a CLI prototype to a web app with Django
- Database‑backed state and session management
- Parser design for natural language input
- Game design principles (pacing, feedback, challenge)
- Value of playtesting and user feedback

## Future Plans
- Additional chapters and story branches
- More sophisticated AI for NPCs
- Achievement system
- Multiple ending paths
