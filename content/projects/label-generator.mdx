## Overview

A browser-based tool for generating professional screw/fastener labels for toolbox organizers. Born from the need to organize metric screws (M2-M6) with a consistent visual system.

## Features

- **Interactive Label Maker**: Filter by size, length, head type, and material
- **Color Code Reference**: Visual chart showing the color coding system
- **Custom Labels**: Create labels for non-standard combinations (saved to localStorage)
- **Print-Ready Output**: Optimized for US Letter at 300 DPI

## Label Design

Each 40×16mm label includes:
- Top bars indicating M size (1 bar = M2, 6 bars = M6)
- Size × Length (e.g., `M3 x 50`)
- Drive and head type
- Material styling (Black = solid fill, Stainless = outline)
- Top-down and side profile drawings

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (self-contained)
- **Label Rendering**: Canvas API (browser-side)

## What I Learned

- Flask application factory pattern
- Canvas API for programmatic image generation
- Print stylesheet optimization for consistent output
- Self-contained HTML tools (all CSS/JS inline, no build step)

## Next Steps

- Server-side label generation with Pillow/ReportLab
- API endpoint for on-demand label creation
- Integration with Where's My App inventory system
