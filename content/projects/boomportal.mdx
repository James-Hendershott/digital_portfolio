## Overview
A home‑lab project to stream games to thin clients using Sunshine on a Pi 5 and Moonlight clients.

## Role & stack
Configured Docker containers, Nginx reverse proxy via NPM, and controller remapping.

## Problem
Needed smooth streaming with low latency across the LAN with multiple device types.

## Solution
- Sunshine container on Pi 5
- NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) for TLS and routing
- Gamepad mapping profiles

```text
Latency ~12–18ms over wired; ~25–35ms over Wi‑Fi 6 (observed).
```

## Results
- Smooth 1080p60 streaming
- One‑click access through reverse proxy

## What I learned
Profiling bottlenecks and mapping inputs are key for perceived performance.
