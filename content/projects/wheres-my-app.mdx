## Overview
Where's My App? is a practical utility designed to help users keep track of their application installations across multiple platforms and devices. It addresses the common problem of forgetting where specific apps are installed or which versions are running on different systems.

## Role & Stack
Solo developer using web technologies to create an intuitive tracking interface.

## Problem
In modern computing environments, users often have multiple devices (laptops, desktops, tablets) and lose track of which applications are installed where. This leads to:
- Duplicate installations
- Version inconsistencies
- Wasted time searching for apps
- Confusion about licensing and installations

## Solution
Created a centralized tracking system that allows users to:
- Log application installations by device
- Track versions and installation dates
- Search and filter applications quickly
- Maintain a personal inventory of software

```javascript
// Example: Application tracking structure
const appEntry = {
  name: "Application Name",
  device: "Device Identifier",
  version: "1.0.0",
  installDate: "2025-10-15",
  platform: "Windows/Mac/Linux"
}
```

## Results
- Simplified software inventory management
- Reduced time spent searching for applications
- Better awareness of installed software across devices
- Foundation for future features like update tracking

## What I Learned
- User-focused design for practical everyday problems
- Importance of clean data structures for tracking applications
- Building simple, focused tools that solve real pain points
- The value of personal productivity tools in understanding user needs
