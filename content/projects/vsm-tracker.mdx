## Problem
As a vendor manager handling multiple vendors and service contracts, I faced:
- Scattered vendor communications across email and documents
- Manual tracking of performance metrics and SLAs
- Time-consuming status updates and reporting
- No centralized view of vendor relationships

## Solution
Built a TypeScript/Node.js application that:
- Centralizes vendor contact information and contracts
- Tracks communication history and follow-ups
- Monitors key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Generates automated reports
- Provides dashboard views of vendor health

```typescript
// Example: Vendor data structure
interface Vendor {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  contacts: Contact[];
  services: Service[];
  metrics: PerformanceMetric[];
  communications: Communication[];
}
```

## Key Features
- Vendor profile management
- Communication logging and search
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Automated reminder system
- Report generation
- SLA tracking

## Results
- Reduced time spent on status tracking by ~40%
- Improved response times to vendor issues
- Better visibility into vendor performance
- Centralized documentation for audits

## What I Learned
- Building tools that solve real business problems
- Balancing private data with portfolio transparency
- Designing small tools that remove repetitive work
- Importance of data security in business applications
- TypeScript for maintainable business logic
- Creating intuitive dashboards for quick insights
