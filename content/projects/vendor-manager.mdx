## Overview
A small browser-based tool to cut down repetitive vendor communication. It generates Outlook deeplinks with prefilled recipients/subject/body and includes quick message generators for common scenarios.

## Role & stack
I designed and built the tool solo using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Deployed as a static page for easy access.

## Problem
Vendor emails were repetitive and error-prone, requiring copy/paste across contacts and message templates.

## Solution
- Centralized common templates
- Generated mailto deeplinks with merged contacts
- Lightweight local storage for user preferences

```js
// Example: build a mailto deeplink
const link = `mailto:${to}?subject=${encodeURIComponent(subject)}&body=${encodeURIComponent(body)}`
```

## Results
- ~50% faster to draft routine messages
- Fewer addressing mistakes

## What I learned
Simple tooling + good defaults can remove real friction for teams.
