## Overview
TrackMate is my senior capstone project—a full-featured MERN stack application designed for comprehensive asset tracking and management. This is the most in-depth project I have worked on, combining complex backend architecture, modern React frontend, role-based security, and production-ready deployment strategies.

## Role & Stack
**Team Lead & Full-Stack Developer**
- **Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js (MERN)
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, environment management
- **Team Size**: [specify if applicable]

**Repository Note**: This is a private repository. Access: https://github.com/bradleypeterson/TrackMate.git

## Project Scope
TrackMate serves as an enterprise-grade asset tracking dashboard that provides:
- Real-time asset monitoring and status updates
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User)
- Comprehensive audit trails for all asset changes
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Reporting and analytics
- Mobile-responsive interface

## Problem
Live data was gated behind VPN. Needed a local development strategy and consistent seed data without exposing sensitive information. Team members needed identical development environments to avoid integration issues.

## Solution
Designed and implemented a Docker-based development environment with seed data:

- **Docker Compose** for orchestrating MongoDB, Node.js API, and React frontend
- **Seed scripts** with realistic JSON fixtures to replace VPN-gated data
- **Environment management** (.env files) for dev vs prod configurations
- **Hot reloading** enabled for rapid development iteration

```yaml
# docker-compose excerpt
services:
  api:
    build: ./api
    environment:
      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://db:27017/trackmate
```

## Results
- **Unblocked Development**: Team could work locally without VPN access
- **Consistent Environments**: Docker eliminated "works on my machine" issues
- **Scalable Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns supports future features
- **Production-Ready**: Successfully deployed with proper security and monitoring

## What I Learned
- **Full-Stack Development**: Deep experience across the entire MERN stack
- **Docker & DevOps**: Container orchestration and environment isolation
- **Team Leadership**: Coordinating technical decisions and architecture choices
- **API Design**: RESTful principles, authentication, and authorization
- **Database Design**: MongoDB schema design, indexing, and aggregation pipelines
- **Problem Solving**: Creative solutions (Docker) to infrastructure blockers (VPN)

**Key Takeaway**: Architecture and tooling decisions early on pay dividends for teams. Setting up proper infrastructure from the start saved countless hours of debugging and synchronization issues.
