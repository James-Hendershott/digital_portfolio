## Overview
Capstone project: a MERN-based asset tracking dashboard with role-based views and audit trails.

## Role & stack
Team lead; designed API endpoints, component structure, and Docker dev environment.

## Problem
Live data was gated behind VPN. Needed a local development strategy and consistent seed data.

## Solution
- Docker Compose for Mongo/Node/React
- Seed scripts and JSON fixtures
- Clear .env management for dev vs prod

```yaml
# docker-compose excerpt
services:
  api:
    build: ./api
    environment:
      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://db:27017/trackmate
```

## Results
- Unblocked dev without VPN
- Repeatable local environment

## What I learned
Architecture and tooling decisions early on pay dividends for teams.
